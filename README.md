Making and committing changes
When you created a new branch in the previous step, GitHub brought you to the code page for your new readme-edits branch, which is a copy of main.

You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.

Under the readme-edits branch you created, click the README.md file.

To edit the file, click .

In the editor, write a bit about yourself. Try using different Markdown elements.
